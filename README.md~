PolynomialManipulator
=====================

The following LISP code defines functions that can be used to 
- construct
- recognize
- factorize
- arithmetically manipulate
- decompose
- partial-split
polynomials of rational coefficients, with a single variable/none.

Construction functions :
	- make-constant
	- make-variable
	- make-sum
	- make-diff
	- make-diff
	- make-product
	- make-power
	- make-simple-polynomial

The user can use make-simple-polynomial to create a polynomial 'object'.
The input is either of the form ((variable-symbol) COEFF (list-of-coefficients-by-order-of-power))
or ((variable-symbol) PAIR (list of (degree coeff) pairs))
Polynmial inputs can be given as (op poly1 poly2) where op is either *, - or + in prefix notation. (^ poly cons) is also a valid input signifying poly to the power of cons.
Polynomials with different variable symbols can be used. The function `compatible` checks whether two polynomials given have the same variables used, if any.
Recognization functions :
- constant-p
- variable-p
- sum-p
- power-p
- simple-p
	
The following function enable polynomial manipulation: 
- simple-sum
- simple-subtract
- simple-product
- divide

Divide returns a quotient, remainder pair
